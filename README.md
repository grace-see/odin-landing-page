# odin-landing-page

This project was to learn how to use basic CSS and flexbox to create a landing page for a website. I learned how to use different properties to achieve the desired look, and this project helped me learn how to research solutions to my problems more effectively. Also, I learned how to use flexbox to create more complex page layouts. Overall, this project felt more practical for real-world applications!
